### Project Overview
Nowadays, areas such as Artificial Intelligence or Software Engineering are on trend, so it might be interesting to know the language that people who work in these sectors speak, isn’t it?

In this article, data from the last three years is to be analyzed in order to provide the reader with information about many programmers and their languages.

To do this, as said before, Stackoverflow’s Annual Developer Surveys are to be used, since this is one of the most important sources of information about the users in the world.

The three questions that will be addressed in this article are:
1 - What has been the evolution of the most used programming languages during the last years?
2 - What has been the evolution of the most wanted programming languages during the last years?
3 - Relationship between company size and most used programming languages during 2019?

### Files in the repository
- stackoverflow_annual_survey_analysis.ipynb

### Instructions to use the code
One can obtain the results by compiling the stackoverflow_annual_survey_analysis.ipynb Jupyter Notebook, although before doing this, the three files in data folder have to be decompressed.
